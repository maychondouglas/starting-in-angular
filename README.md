# Starting in Angular

This project is part of my learning in angular (first project I builded in angular)

## CRUD

Here, I make a CRUD of products, but can be modified to others things CRUD. The products are inserted in a back-end "hardcode" fake REST API, builded through do [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server).

# Starting in Angular

This project is part of my learning in angular (first project I builded in angular)

After install the Angular CLI, to create a new project make:
´´´
ng new nome-do-projeto
´´´

Now, to execute the project server, inside the project folder make:
´´´
ng serve
´´´

## CRUD

Here, I make a CRUD of products, but can be modified to others things CRUD. The products are inserted in a back-end "hardcode" fake REST API, builded through do [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server).
